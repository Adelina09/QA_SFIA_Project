### Proposal
---

## Trello Board
---

I used a kanban board on Trello to manage my workflow during the project, the board was set to public to enable overview and broadcast. Agile methodology was implemented in line with the brief, in terms of product and sprint backlog, although due to the individual nature of the project, no scrum working practices were implemented. The board was set up with reference to potential user stories emphasising the CRUD functionality of the database system. Although unrequired, a Task Backlog was instituted in order to keep the requirements of the project spec clear, so as to enable sprint tasks to be dynamically allocated to them.

Due to this setup sprints could be passed through development, and, if required, testing, before being assigned to Done. Once sprints generated by a backlogged Task have been completed, the task itself can be marked Done. Errors, mistakes, and software bugs are given over to the newly added Bugs column, to be fed back to development and testing when identified and processed.

### Start Point

![A picture of the trello board, started on the first week. The Product Backlog, The Sprint Backlog, the Tasks for the first week have been added. Only the 'Start the Trello board' task has been completed](https://i.imgur.com/op4ChN4.png)

At the start of the project, I focussed on the four tasks most easily completable in the first week of training: Starting the Kanban board [itself](200~https://trello.com/b/8xaM1s0K/qa-week-5-individual-project-hotsaucerecipe), starting this document to streamline my future workflow, instituting a github repository for the project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/THC-QA/QA_SFIA_Project), and initialising the risk assessment for the project in line with my initial understanding.
